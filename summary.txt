Project: Visualizing and Analyzing Sentiment of Streamed Tweets Using Google Maps and the Google Cloud Language Platform

Categories: Document Search (Twitter API produces a JSON file to perform analysis and visualizations upon); Social Networks (Twitter API retrieves data from a corpus of tweets worldwide & Google Maps API visualizes tweets); Information Networks (using the Google Cloud Language API to analyze sentiment of tweets)

This is an app that maps sentiment of tweets across the world visually. It collects tweets in real-time based on the number of seconds you wish to collect it for. (The Twitter API does not allow you to get tweets over a certain period of time due to privacy issues most likely). This code only collects tweets that have coordinates associated with it, which is about 1-2% of tweets since users typically don't like to reveal their location. Then it is able to associate each of the tweets with a sentiment that ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 (very negative to very positive) using the Google Cloud Natural Language API. A user can upload the tweets they want to visualize. 

The way that the sentiment is mapped related to market color is red if on a scale between -1 and -0.5 (negative), a light orange between -0.5 and 0 (somewhat negative), a light yellow/white between 0 and 0.5 (somewhat positive), and then green between 0.5 and 1 (positive).

There are about 500 tweets mapped in the sample data set final_tweets.json uploaded here which was collected for 5 minutes on 4/28/2018.

Tnis work was done independently with help from various links that are commented in the code.
